**Lumina** is a minimalist, wellness-inspired mobile application built to demonstrate mastery over Flutter’s navigation stack and motion design. Developed as a core internship task, the app focuses on fluid screen transitions and a high-fidelity user interface.

## 🚀 Overview
The primary goal of this project was to implement a multi-screen architecture using a "Stack-based" navigation approach. Lumina moves beyond basic routing by incorporating custom animations that enhance the tactile feel of the UI.

### Key Technical Implementations:
* **Navigator Stack**: Seamless transitions using `Navigator.push()` and `Navigator.pop()`.
* **Custom Micro-animations**: Implementation of `PageRouteBuilder` for bespoke slide-and-fade effects.
* **Hero Motion**: Shared element transitions for a unified brand experience across screens.
* **Stateful Navigation**: Utilizing `popUntil` to manage complex back-stack scenarios.

## 📱 App Flow
1.  **Home Screen**: A welcoming entry point featuring high-contrast gradients and an animated logo.
2.  **Statistics Screen**: A data-driven view showcasing "Glassmorphic" card designs.
3.  **Profile Screen**: A clean user management interface with a centralized exit strategy back to the root.
